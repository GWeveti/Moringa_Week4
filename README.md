### OBJECTIVE
"Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018?" is the research topic for this project. In order to break down the processes and various tactics, one will use the CRISP-DM technique. One will also use python programming to aid in comprehending how the analysis was carried out and prompting recommendations to help the electric car sharing company. Some questions to get one started;

1.What is the most popular hour for returning cars?
2.What station is the most popular? Overall?
3.At the most popular picking hour?
4.What postal code is the most popular for picking up Blue cars? Does the most popular station belong to that postal code? Overall?
5.At the most popular picking hour?
6.Do the results change if you consider Utilib and Utilib 1.4 instead of Blue cars?

### PROCEDURE
1. Data Preparation

One will choose the data, clean, integrate, and generate the data needed for analysis at this phase in the CRISP-DM technique. One will then identify which bits of the provided dataset are required for analysis and which are not by constructing required data. Any duplicate data will be removed, one will also do data scrubbing, check for missing values, and general data cleaning in this stage. It also entails the formatting of data. The quality of the data I'll be using for my analysis will be determined at this stage.

2. Data Analysis

It involves selection of modeling methodologies and the identification of a model to be utilized in choosing the best approach. A model is created and evaluated while test designs are created.

3. Conclusion

Evaluation is then done to aid in the determination of the data's accuracy and its importance. It determines whether the conclusions gained from the data presented, after analysis, meet the research question's objectives.

4. Recommendation

One will then provide recommendations based on the research issue to help the electric car sharing company to identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018

### Software used
1. Python programming
2. Google collab
